The Simons Laufer Mathematical Institute (previously known as MSRI) 
hosts two-week programs for graduate students across the US to 
study special topics in mathematics. Typically, they also provide 
funding and housing for students to attend, so I highly recommend 
applying if there's a topic of interest to you (see their [website](https://www.slmath.org/) for a full list of programs).


In July 2023, I was a TA for SLMath 1064,
[Mathematics of Big Data and Sketching](https://www.slmath.org/summer-schools/1064#overview_summer_graduate_school).
There were graduate students from across the United States, and even
a few international ones. Lior Horesh, Kenneth Clarkson, 
Misha Kilmer, Shashanka Ubaru, and Tamara Kolda were the instructors
for the school, which took place at the beautiful IBM Research campus
in Almaden, CA. I had the pleasure to work with fellow TAs 
Yijun Dong and Rachel Minster. 

### Logistics 
The students stayed at the dormitories of San Jose State university
and took a bus to the summer school every day, which took place over
two weeks in an auditorium on the Almaden research campus. 
There was a breakfast of
fresh fruit and muffins for students and staff, and each morning
there was a lecture for slightly more than an hour. After a break,
the students received a problem set to work on until lunch at noon,
which we usually ate outside under a leafy canopy atop a hill. 
Temperatures regularly exceeded 80 Farenheit outside, but the
auditorium was air-conditioned. 

The afternoon session was a mirror of the morning: a lecture, 
followed by a break and problem sets (there was a tea snack 
provided!). At the end of the day, dinners were provided in brown
paper bags for the students before they boarded the bus back to the
dorm. 

They fed us well! But we needed it. Thinking through / helping others
with problem sets made us all hungry.

### Problem Sets and Curriculum
Each of the two problem sets assigned per day was comparable 
in length to a weekly university homework assignment. 
The students worked in 
groups so that they could finish the problems in the short 
time alotted, while the TAs roamed between the groups to help. Given
two lectures (roughly 2.5-3 hours) and 3 hours of homework
per day, I estimate that the summer school covered roughly the same
content as a standard quarter-long mathematics course in just two
weeks. By the end, everyone was exhausted. 

The first week of the summer school covered the basics of linear 
algebra and the mathematics of randomization and sketching, a tool
used to decrease the computational cost of expensive linear algebra
primitives. The second week covered tensors, which are generalize
matrices and vectors to higher dimensions. 

I work at the intersection of these topics. In addition
to TAing, I was gratified to meet some of the heavyweights
in both fields, and we had many productive discussions.

### Research Seminar and Career Panel 

By student request, the last day of the program was a seminar
of research talks given by the students; 17 of the participants
shared their research, and all three of us TAs presented our work
as well.

I think the students really enjoyed the feedback from
the instructors - I certainly did. The last two hours consisted
of a career panel, where the instructors and the other two TAs
(who were postdocs) shared advice for the students. I usually sleep
through career panels, so I was really surprised by how engaged
the students were. They asked so many questions that we ran out
of time. 

If you have the chance to attend one of these summer schools, it's
a wonderful experience. IBM Almaden was also one of the most quiet,
beautiful tech campuses I have ever seen, surrounded by the serene
Santa Teresa Hills. I hope to go back one day.
