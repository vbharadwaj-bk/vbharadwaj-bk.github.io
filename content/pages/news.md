      Austin Glover and I are thrilled to announce [OpenEquivariance](https://github.com/vbharadwaj-bk/OpenEquivariance), 
      a fast kernel generator for rotation equivariant deep neural networks. These machine learning models rotate their predictions
      in a compatible way when the input (a point cloud) rotates. Read
      it [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13986).

      [Beheshteh Rakhshan](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=AWGU-v8AAAAJ&hl=en) and I,
      along with [Osman Asif Malik](https://osmanmalik.github.io/) and 
      [Guillaume Rabusseau](https://www-labs.iro.umontreal.ca/~grabus/),
      worked on [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02749) on sketching
      tensor train core chains. It was just accepted as a poster to NeurIPS 2024.

      I am thrilled to receive Berkeley's
      [Teaching Effectiveness Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/teaching-effectiveness/) (2023-2024). The prize comes with a $500
      check, and the list of winners is [online](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/teaching-effectiveness/tea-recipients/tea-year/tea-2020-2025/). Read my essay [on my blog]({filename}/posts/tea_essay.md) or

      Charles Block, Gerasimos Gerogiannis, and three other wonderful researchers
      from UIUC and IU built on the [code](https://github.com/PASSIONLab/distributed_sddmm) from our [2022 IPDPS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07673). 
      Read their ASPLOS 2024 paper [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3620665.3640427).
      **Update**: Nabil Abubaker and Torsten Hoefler (ETH Zurich) also tested our code!
      Their paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19638).
