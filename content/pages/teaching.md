  - title: "[Mathematics of Big Data: Sketching and Multi-Linear Algebra](https://www.slmath.org/summer-schools/1064#overview_summer_graduate_school)"
    subtitle: July 2023, Teaching Assistant.

      Two-week graduate summer program about randomized sketching algorithms and tensor computations.
      I gave a talk about my work on the last day
      of the program; check out the [video](https://player.vimeo.com/video/852491761). 
      
  - title: "[Applications of Parallel Computers](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/cs267-spr2022)" 
    subtitle: Spring 2022, Teaching Assistant.

      üèÖ **[2024 Teaching Effectiveness Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/teaching-effectiveness/)**

      üèÖ **[2023 Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award](https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/)**

      Semester-long course on Parallel Computing. Check out my 
      [recitation slides]({static}/pdf/gemm_knl_slides.pdf) 
      and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGW4GPX7s5I) on optimizing GEMM for the Intel Knights Landing processor. I was very happy to receive OGSI and
      TEA awards for this work - check out the [EECS news note](https://eecs.berkeley.edu/news/vivek-bharadwaj-and-yicheng-zhu-receive-teaching-effectiveness-award/)
      about it.

  - title: Algorithms 
    subtitle: Spring 2020, Spring 2019, Spring 2018, Teaching Assistant.

      üèÖ **[2020 Thomas A. Tisch Prize](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/academics/honors#thomas-a-tisch-prize-for-undergraduate-teaching-in-computing-and-mathematical-sciences)**

      Proof-based algorithms course. I taught three times over three years (2018, 2019, 2020); responsibilities
      included grading homework, holding office hours, and testing exam questions. 
      
      During the COVID-19 pandemic (before Zoom had non-random breakout rooms), I deployed a
      [queue](https://github.com/mterwill/office-hours-help-queue) where students could enter in their own
      Zoom numbers and get help from TAs. The wait times for help were long, but I'm proud that we jury-rigged
      a solution for virtual office hours so quickly. 

  - title: Decidability and Tractability 
    subtitle: Winter 2018, Teaching Assistant.
    badge: Caltech CS21

      Introductory complexity theory course. Besides grading homework and exams, I gave two 
      lectures on NP-completeness while my professor was out (not my slides / content, but it was great
      public speaking experience).

I was a teaching assistant for four classes on algorithms / complexity as an undergraduate at 
Caltech, and one class on parallel computing at Berkeley. All of these classes had 100+ students! 
You can find the reviews that the students left me in the files below. Information that personally 
identifies students has been redacted. Scroll down to the last page of the Berkeley review document 
to see comments that I received.

- [Reviews from UC Berkeley]({static}/pdf/teaching_reviews/reviews_berkeley.pdf).
- [Reviews from Caltech]({static}/pdf/teaching_reviews/reviews_caltech.pdf). These reviews have been 
condensed to remove information that doesn't relate 
to me. 

In July 2023, I also TA'd an summer program 
held by the Simons Laufer Mathematical Institute.
